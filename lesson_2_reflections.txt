1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

To make git track the history of a directory (Repository) we have to do git init in that directory.
Doing so will make a folder named .git that contains the history.
Note that there are no initail commita made yet. 
We have to make a commit manualy.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a place where the files to be tracked are present.
A repository or a working directory contains all the files, tracked and untracked.
It offers us flexibility to decide what files to be kept track of.
